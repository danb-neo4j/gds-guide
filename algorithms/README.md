# Neo4j Graph Data Science Algorithms 

The following pages contain summaries of selected algorithms in the [Neo4j Graph Data Science library](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/). The objective is to provide easily-digestible and easily-comparable summaries of the algorithms to help data scientists decide when and how to use each. Summaries for the following algorithm families are available:
* [Centrality](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/gds-guide/blob/main/algorithms/gds_centrality.md): Centrality algorithms are used to determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network based upon their relationships and position within the network. 
* [Community Detection](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/gds-guide/blob/main/algorithms/gds_community.md): Community detection algorithms are used to evaluate how groups of nodes are clustered or partitioned, as well as their tendency to strengthen or break apart. 
* [Similarity](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/gds-guide/blob/main/algorithms/gds_similarity.md): Similarity algorithms compute the similarity of pairs of nodes based on their neighborhoods or their properties.
* [Pathfinding](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/gds-guide/blob/main/algorithms/gds_pathfinding.md): Path finding algorithms find the path between two or more nodes or evaluate the availability and quality of paths. 


The summaries are organized by algorithm family and each contains the following:
* Overview
* Pros
* Cons
* When to use

These summaries do not contain syntax, configuration, or hyperparameter deatils. Consult the official documentation for that information, which is linked for each algorithm.


*DISCLAIMER: This is an unofficial guide and does not include all algorithms in the GDS library. Consult the [official Neo4j Graph Data Science documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/) for the most up-to-date, authoritative content about the GDS library and individual algorithms.*
