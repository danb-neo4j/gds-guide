# Neo4j Graph Data Science Algorithms 

The following pages contain summaries of selected algorithms in the [Neo4j Graph Data Science library](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/). The objective is to provide easily-digestible and easily-comparable summaries of the algorithms to help data scientists decide when and how to use each. Summaries for the following algorithm families are available:
* [Centrality](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/gds-guide/blob/main/algorithms/gds_centrality.md)
* [Community Detection](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/gds-guide/blob/main/algorithms/gds_community.md)


The summaries are organized by algorithm family and each contains the following:
* Overview
* Pros
* Cons
* When to use

These summaries do not contain syntax, configuration, or hyperparameter deatils. Consult the official documentation for that information, which is linked for each algorithm.


*DISCLAIMER: This is an unofficial guide and does not include all algorithms in the GDS library. Consult the [official Neo4j Graph Data Science documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/) for the most up-to-date, authoritative content about the GDS library and individual algorithms.*
