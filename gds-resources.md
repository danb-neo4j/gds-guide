# Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) Resources

## Overview
*The following are different resources that provide an overview of Graph Data Science and Neo4jâ€™s implementation. Except for the newly published book, these resources are largely conceptual.* 
* Graph Academy: [Intro to Neo4j Graph Data Science](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/gds-product-introduction/)
* Graph Academy: [GDS Fundamentals](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/graph-data-science-fundamentals/)
* [Neo4j Graph Data Science Manual](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/introduction/)
* Video: [Graph Data Science 2.0 Overview](https://www.youtube.com/live/spmLJ3AHMPY?feature=share)
* [Manager's Guide to GDS](https://go.neo4j.com/rs/710-RRC-335/images/Neo4j-Improve-Predictive-Analytics-Managers-Guide.pdf)
* Book: [Graph Data Science with Neo4j](https://www.packtpub.com/product/graph-data-science-with-neo4j/9781804612743?_ga=2.241932810.927399793.1677686012-1354588147.1677686012) A newly-published book that also walks through Neo4j and the GDS library in-depth. 

## GDS Python Client
*The GDS Python Client is one of the primary ways data scientists interact with Neo4j and GDS.*
* [GDS Python Client Manual](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/)
* Blog: [How to Get Started With the Neo4j Graph Data Science Python Client](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/get-started-with-neo4j-gds-python-client/)
* Workshop: [Road to NODES - Graph EDA Using the Neo4j GDS Client](https://www.youtube.com/live/oG9InPntehQ?feature=share)

## Graph Projections

## Algorithms Overview
*Neo4j GDS contains a substantial library of optimized algorithms The following are high-level resources. As this guide is developed, more resources will be added for specific categories.*
* Book: [Graph Algorithms for Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/graph-algorithms-for-data-science) This is a book, currently being written by independent engineer and graph data specialist Tomaz Bratanic, is a valuable resource for learning Neo4j Graph Data Science. It incorporates multiple notebooks and data sets and walks the user through the entire graph data science process including embeddings. *Note: As of April 2023 it is still in draft and may not yet be updated for Neo4j 5.x and new versions of the GDS library. The book is still highly, highly recommended.

## Embeddings
*Graph Embeddings are low-dimensional vectors that represent the nodes and edges of a graph. They are powerful tools to capture the structure and contents of a graph in a way that can be visualized, used with other graph algorithms, or passed to machine learning pipelines. The following resources may also be useful in learning about graph embeddings and how to most effectively use them:*
* GDS Manual: [Node embeddings](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/)
* Blog: [Getting Started with Graph Embeddings in Neo4j](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-graph-embeddings-2f06030e97ae)
* Blog: [Understanding graph embeddings with Neo4j and Emblaze](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-embeddings-with-neo4j-and-emblaze-7e2d6ef56b8c)
* GDS Manual: [FastRP and KNN Example](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/end-to-end-examples/fastrp-knn-example/)
* Blog: [Making FastRP Graph Embeddings Work for You](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-fastrp-graph-embeddings-work-for-you-f7344a535dc3)
