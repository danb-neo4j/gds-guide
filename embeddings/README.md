# Node Embeddings

## Node Embeddings Overview
Node embeddings are vector representations of nodes in a graph. Put another way, they are a set of numerical values that represent the structural and/or attribute information of a node, similar to how language models represent text as embeddings.

Node embeddings are useful for a variety of tasks, including:
* Visualization of graph data in two or three dimensions
* Machine learning tasks such as node classification, link prediction, or property prediction
* Dimensionality reduction of graph data

## Graph Data Science Node Embeddings Guides
The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library currently supports four node embedding algorithms, with each having its own strengths and weaknesses. The unofficial guides provide an overview of the different node embedding algorithms along with their pros, cons, and use cases.
